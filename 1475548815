on bsd kernels, you can execute scripts with mode 100
why this?  because execve will open the file for you and pass `/dev/fd/num` as
an argument to the interpreter

so this happens:
- if you have a script that starts with `#!/usr/bin/env python`, you can read
it with `ln /bin/cat ./python; PATH=. ./myscript`
- if you use ktrace you can read that script
- if you attach with gdb you can read that script
- if procfs is mounted you can read that script
- if you use `chmod -R o-r /my/dir` your scripts are still readable

yay security
