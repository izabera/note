izalove | ok so you create a fifo and try to read from it
izalove | if there's no writer, open blocks
izalove | so this can take an arbitrarily long time and uses virtually zero resources  : < fifo
izalove | so one can write a loop that looks like this        while : < fifo; do stuff to do here; done
izalove | put that loop in bg
izalove | run several loops like that with different bodies, each loop reads from a different fifo
izalove | now create a central function that handles some event
izalove | that function just does this when it gets the event      : > fifo123
izalove | and the loop that reads from fifo123 suddenly wakes up and does one iteration
izalove | this way one can register event handlers
izalove | and this doesn't even need a central function to handle events, just anything that opens a fifo for a moment will be fine
izalove | -fin-
